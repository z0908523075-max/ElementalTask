"""Blended 組合 任務 combining multiple 推理 primitives.

These items are designed to look more downstream-like than 純字串 transforms:
- coref_tracking_query: resolve pronouns, then do entity-state tracking
- opplan_solve: choose 操作 sequence, then compute numeric 結果
- decipher_apply_reason: infer token mapping and apply it to a 新的 query
- extract_verify: 擷取 facts from 文字 and verify a claim
