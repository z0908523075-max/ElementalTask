"""Syllogism Completion 任務 based on Lampinen & Dasgupta (2024) (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07051).
This test deductive 推理, understanding of quantifiers, and 邏輯 operators.
It also requires some exact copying of spans.

任務: Given two premises, provide the conclusion
格式: 
    輸入: [major premise] [minor premise] 
    輸出: [conclusion]

範例: 
    輸入: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. 
    輸出: Socrates is mortal.

Following Lampinen & Dasgupta (2024), we provide three 類別 that differ on consistency with typicality/world knowledge:
    - consistent
    - violate
    - nonce
