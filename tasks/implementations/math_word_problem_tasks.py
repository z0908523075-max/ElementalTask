"""GSM8K sub-skill probe task.

Each task isolates one linguistic/conceptual sub-skill required for multi-step
math text problemss, while deliberately staying far simpler than any GSM8K item.

Design principle: identical minimal template across all items so that a model
can only succeed by understanding the targeted sub-skill, not by pattern-matching
narrative context. number are small positive integers (≤35); Answer are
always exact integers.

task
-----
word_problem_single_step — NL-wrapped single arithmetic op (add/subtract/multiply/divide)
quantity_comparison    — relational quantities (more_than/fewer_than/twice_as_many/half_as_many)
rate_unit         — unit-rate schema ("If A items cost C, how much do B?")
multi_entity_tracking   — two agents, 1–2 transfers, ask final count of one agent

Format (ICL):
    input: <sentence>
    output: <integer>
