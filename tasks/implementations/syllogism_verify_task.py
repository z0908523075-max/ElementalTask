"""Syllogism Verification 任務 based on Lampinen & Dasgupta (2024) (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07051).

任務: Given two premises and a conclusion, determine if the conclusion
logically follows from the premises.
格式：
    輸入: [major premise] [minor premise] Therefore, [conclusion]
    輸出: 有效 / 無效

Following Lampinen & Dasgupta (2024), we provide three 類別 that differ on
consistency with typicality/world knowledge:
    - consistent: premises and conclusions align with world knowledge
    - violate: logically 有效 conclusions that violate world knowledge
    - nonce: nonsense 詞 isolate pure 邏輯 推理 from world knowledge
