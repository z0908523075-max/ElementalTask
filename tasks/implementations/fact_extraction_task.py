"""Fact 擷取 from 上下文 — elemental reading comprehension.

Tests the 模型's ability to 擷取 a 特定 fact from a short passage
given a 問題. This is the core skill underlying virtually all QA benchmarks.

類別：
  - extract_entity:  "Who/What" 問題 about named entities
  - extract_number:  "How many/much" 問題 about quantities
  - extract_location: "Where" 問題 about places

格式化(ICL):
    Passage: "The cat sat on the red mat in the kitchen."
    問題: Where is the mat?
    答案: the kitchen

Each 類別 tests a different 擷取 tar取得type while keeping
the passages 簡單 and unambiguous.
