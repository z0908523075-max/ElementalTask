"""邏輯 operators — elemental 推理 primitives.

Tests the 模型's capacity for basic 邏輯 操作 in 文字 form:
    - negation:   Verify whether a candidate is a 正確 邏輯 negation
    - conjunction: 評估conjunction/disjunction statements from 文字 facts
    - conditional: Decide whether a conclusion follows from a rule + fact

These are building blocks for reasoning-heavy benchmarks.

格式化(ICL):
    輸入: [文字 logic problem]
    輸出: True or False
    (varies by 類別 — see demos)
