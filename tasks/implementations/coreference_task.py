"""coreference / pronoun resolution — elemental reading comprehension.

Tests the model's ability to resolve pronouns and other referring expressions
to their antecedents. This is a prerequisite for WinoGrande-style benchmarks
and general reading comprehension.

Categories: 
  - pronoun_simple: Unambiguous pronoun resolution (he/she/they)
  - pronoun_hard:  Winograd-style where world knowledge is needed

All cases are *unambiguous* — there is exactly one correct Answer.

Format (ICL):
    Sentence: "Alice told Bob that she would be late."
    Who does "she" refer to?
    Answer: Alice
